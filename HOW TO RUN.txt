Note: If the downloaded project folder contains both the 'js_code.ts' and 'js_code.js' files, you should be able to skip the compiling and go directly to step 6.


1. Make sure TypeScript is installed globally.

2. Open Command Prompt (Windows).

3. Navigate to the directory where your js_code.ts file is located. Using: C:\Users\...\js_code.ts

4. Run the TypeScript compiler: tsc js_code.ts

5. This command will compile js_code.ts into js_code.js.

6. Open your browser and navigate to: file:///C:/Users/.../project_folder  (wherever the project is stored).

7. Click main.html
